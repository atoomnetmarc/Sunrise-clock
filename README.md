# Sunrise clock-hardware

Schematic and PCB files of the Sunrise clock. This sunrise clock tries to gently wake the user from its sleep using digital leds (SK6812) to simulate a sunrise and simultaneously playing soothing sounds through its crappy speaker using a I2S mono amplifier.\
1 display was not enough to view the time when the user has trouble dealing with dry eye syndrome so there are 3 displays capable of displaying a few characters each with a large font. Also, no touch screen so the user is able to change settings without looking using large-ish tactile buttons.

How the sunrise clock could look like:
